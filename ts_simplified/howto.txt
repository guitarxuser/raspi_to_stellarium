                 How to drive the simplified perl version of telescope server
                 on a pc (win/linux) or raspberrypi
                 
                 Install as first the telescope plugin on Stellarium
                 and configure control with extern software on port 10000
                 
                 1. To run a dummy server put on the cmd line:
                 
                    perl ts_simplified_dummy.pl
                    to stop push ctrl + c
                 
                 2. To test the communication between Stellarium and the server
                    the coordinates are sended by mouse click on the sky and
                    pushing (ctrl + 1) or (ctrl + 2) keys,
                    run the receiver test on cmd line with:
                 
                    perl ts_receiver_test.pl
                    to stop push ctrl + c
                    
                 3. This step works just on raspberrypi with gpio hardware.
                    To start the ts_simpified.pl server go to the scripts 
                    directory an run the script
                 
                    sh start_ts_simplified.sh
                    to stop the server open second xterm session and
                    go to scripts and put the command:
                    
                    sh stop_telescope.sh
